Aim : The main goal of our machine learning project was a prediction of the chances of hypertension in individuals on the basis of data analysis. This project covered getting and cleaning a dataset, which consisted of variables such as age, BMI and physical activity, and dietary habits. We subsequently worked on data cleaning to fill-in missing values and excluded outlying values. We did EDA to understand the interconnectedness and patterns of the data. The model that was trained with the split dataset method, optimized through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, and using metrics like Mean Absolute Error and R-squared to evaluate the model performance was used. The project has developed a predictive model that can properly identify people at high risk of experiencing hypertension. Therefore, the model can provide important insights that will enable early interventions. Discovered impediments included faulty data, a situation that was overcome by paying great attention to detail during data preprocessing and choosing the most suitable modeling approaches. This project demonstrates the role of machine learning in how it improves precision medicine and predictive health.

TECH STACK 

1.Programming Language:
●Python is widely used for machine learning projects due to its extensive libraries and frameworks like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
●Libraries like pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
●Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for preprocessing tasks like scaling and encoding.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Project Impact :
The project can make a big difference in healthcare. If we can predict who might get high blood pressure early on, doctors can help them stay healthy and avoid serious problems. It's like giving a heads-up to doctors so they can take action and keep people well. This way, our project has the potential to really help improve healthcare and make a positive impact on people's lives.





Conclusion:

In conclusion, our hypertension risk prediction project aimed to predict high blood pressure risks using data analysis and machine learning. We successfully tackled challenges in data cleaning and exploration, and the model we built has the potential to make a positive impact on healthcare.
